# CrowdCam
Users can post photos and videos to capture their POV at various events and share with the public. Essentially, adding a method of capturing moments that doesn't fall into the "story" format. Imagine social media + file storage wrapped into one app?

- Crowsource bullet time footage or capture after-movie footage for smaller-scale events
- Capture filming location data
- auto stitch together a montage that uses both time and location of highlight clips when choosing how to order them
- Supporters in a sporting event could create multi angle coverage and replays
- MVP is a software layer over inviting people to sync their footage on a timelines by the video's metadata. 
- Add facial or body tracking to better focus on certain person throughout clips

- What happens when multiple people try to upload heavy media? (slow app performance)
- How to filter out blurry images or low quality videos.
